        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At PassivPods, we believe that healthy, comfortable living should be accessible to everyone. Our mission is to create high-quality, sustainable homes that offer unmatched comfort and energy efficiency. We achieve this by:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Embracing the Passivhaus standard in our designs and construction to deliver homes that naturally maintain an ideal indoor environment.</li>
            <li>Leveraging prefabricated construction methods, which not only reduce costs but also protect projects from weather-related delays, ensuring a faster and more reliable building process.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Through these approaches, we’re committed to delivering homes that prioritize exceptional air quality, comfort, and energy savings for every resident.</p>

        <h2>Our Principles</h2>
        <p>Each of our pods is designed to meet or exceed the stringent requirements of the Passivhaus standard, offering unparalleled comfort, efficiency, and quality. Here’s what sets our pods apart:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Continuous Insulation:</strong> A seamless insulation layer is vital. Even a small, 16mm gap can reduce insulation efficiency by 35%. <a href="https://www.buildmagazine.org.nz/assets/PDF/BUILD117-68-Research---Poorly-fitted-insulation.pdf" target="_blank">[Source]</a></li>
            <li><strong>Minimizing Thermal Bridges:</strong> Thermal bridges, such as exposed metal beams, allow heat to escape and can cause cold spots, condensation, and even mold, all of which affect comfort and health.</li>
            <li><strong>Airtightness:</strong> Our pods are built to an airtightness level of 0.6 ACH at 50 Pascals (tested with a blower door). This minimizes drafts and ensures a stable indoor environment, promoting high air quality and energy efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Performance Windows and Doors:</strong> We use Passivhaus-certified, double-glazed windows and doors that maintain indoor temperatures while bringing in natural light.</li>
            <li><strong>Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR):</strong> Our MVHR system ensures a continuous flow of fresh air while retaining heat from the outgoing air, improving both energy efficiency and indoor air quality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While our pods are not officially certified by Passivhaus, we guarantee they exceed its standards, ensuring a comfortable, efficient living experience.</p>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Hello! I’m Daniel Tscherry, founder of PassivPods. My passion for the Passive House approach to healthy, sustainable living drives me to create spaces that truly enrich lives. Here’s a bit about my journey:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Certified Carpenter</strong> with over four years of experience in constructing certified passive homes.</li>
                <li><strong>Passivhaus Design Graduate:</strong> Completed an intensive two-week course in Passive House design, gaining specialized knowledge to ensure each pod meets exacting standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Driven by Family:</strong> Growing up in Australia’s challenging climate, and inspired by my daughter’s asthma, I’m deeply motivated to create homes with superior air quality and comfort.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmentally Committed:</strong> I have a deep respect for Australia’s unique ecosystems and the ancestral custodians of our land.</li>
                <li><strong>Founder and Director of Transcend Carpentry:</strong> For four years, I founded and ran Transcend Carpentry, a Canberra-based business focused on Passive House construction and renovations. I’m proud of our 4.8-star rating on Google, reflecting our dedication to quality and customer satisfaction.</li>

            <div class="review">
                <h4>Meg – Hughes, Canberra</h4>
                <p><em>Positive: Professionalism, Punctuality, Quality, Responsiveness</em></p>
                <p>Daniel replaced all 24 of our windows and doors with triple-glazed units. The quality of the workmanship is excellent, and we are really impressed with the end result. It has transformed the performance and appearance of the house. Because of the age and design of the house and previous renovations, there were lots of quirks to overcome, which Daniel did, always finding neat solutions. He also helped us out by doing an additional job to replace cladding.</p>
                <p>Daniel was great to deal with - always communicated when he would be there and arrived on time. He was very considerate not to inconvenience us, and would always clean up thoroughly at the end of the day. I highly recommend Transcend Carpentry and will definitely use them in the future for any other jobs we have.</p>

            <div class="review">
                <h4>Anthony - Oxley, Canberra</h4>
                <p>Very happy client - Transcend Carpentry installed the 11 triple-glazed uPVC windows for our home in Canberra, ACT. All windows were initially measured for ordering by Daniel and were fitted and sealed extremely well; architraves and sills were installed and left looking fantastic. Daniel communicated well about when he would be working at our home. As he was replacing existing windows, he always found good solutions for unexpected issues that arose in our house, which was built in 1985. My wife and I are both very pleased with the installation of the windows and the windows themselves. Job well done. Thank you, Transcend Carpentry.</p>

            <div class="review">
                <h4>Kaye – Goulburn, NSW</h4>
                <p>Transcend was recommended to us by a satisfied client. Daniel assisted us by rectifying some building errors on our new-build Passive House just outside Goulburn. His work is thorough, his knowledge is extensive, and we are happy to recommend him to others.</p>
